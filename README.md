# repTile 0.1

A simple and small Tiling script for KDE.

### Main goal of the Project

- learn KDE scripting
- build something fun and useful
- make it free and public

### Ideas/Requirements as of now without any roadmap for the current subversion

- To build the core functionality even if it is tightly coupled to the KWIN script interfaces
- Autotile Windows after creation to the next free space
- Hardcoded ignore list for Windows which should NOT be tiled automatically
- Move Windows from a Workspace to another should trigger re-tile in both of the workspaces
- Remove a Window from a tile, put it into "floating"
- It should be possible to move a Window in different position within a tiled Workspace
  - swap places
  - if the Window was not assigned to any Tile yet, then split the Tile into two

### Already finished

- none
